Robot Game - for the year  
We coded these missions - Windmill, Television, Oil Platform, Water Reservoir,

We divided the map in two parts and split our team in two groups to do different missions instead of two people doing one mission and two people working on something else.
  
We used our creativity to make attachments. One of these attachments looks like a crate with an open roof. This is so that we collect the energy units from the windmill. We made a rack and pinion so that we could make linear motions for the Oil Platform. We used a hook to lift up the lever which releases the water unit from the hydro-electric dam. We built a passive attachment that resembles a C and is a collector and pusher.

We looked at the board and found that it was a certain color that would work for the line-follower . We made a line-follower to follow the line accurately so we could get to the mission without any problems. We used the block of code that stated: wire that is connected to port “F” will be a color sensor and will move until it finds the said color. In our case, we had to use the color white. 

We also made my-blocks. These my-blocks will have variables which in turn, will make it easier in the way that we don’t have to put and remember the specific parameters to input into the word blocks that we code with. We measured the speeds and movements of the required parameters. Some of them are 25 percent speed with an input of 85 degrees than moves 90 degrees because of the 5 degrees correction. 50 percent speed  with 70 degrees input moves 90 degrees because of the 20 degrees correction. This simplifies the code for us. Some examples are: when we were coding the windmill, we used the my-blocks and variables to make the code more accurate
