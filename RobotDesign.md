Robot Design
Base
Used Spike Prime
Base robot-Advanced Drive Base (ADB)
-This is designed by Arvind and Sanjay Seshan
-This ADB robot had the requirement we wanted, colors sensor, large motors, and medium motors
-Easy to put attachments on
-Easy to align
Goal: Make it it a box robot
-Last year, we had alignment issues with the robot  so we wanted to make it a box robot so it would be easy to align.
Sensor-Used 2 color sensors, 2 large motors, and 2 small motors
-When we used Ev3 last year, we didnâ€™t have color sensors and it was hard to do the missions precisely, so this year we added 2 color sensor to the Spike Prime
-In the ADB, there is 2 medium motors, one in the front and one in the back, and this is helpful to do more missions in a single run
Wheels
-used the big wheels that comes in the Spike Prime set
-Moves farther in 1 rotation that the small wheels that come in the Spike Prime set
Gear Box
-We used gearboxes to use active attachments
-Used gear trains to do the gear boxes
Attachments
Rack and Pinion
-The rack and pinion is easy to have a linear motion
-The rack and pinion we used is for an up and down motion
Energy Unit Collector
-A big box to collect energy units
C-shaped Pusher
-A C-shaped attachment to push something somewhere
Hook
-The hook is used to lift lever on the Hydroelectric Dam up to release the Water Unit to replace the Energy Unit
